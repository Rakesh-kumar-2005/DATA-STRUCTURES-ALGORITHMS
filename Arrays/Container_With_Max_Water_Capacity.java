        Description :-
                Given an array where each element represents the height of a vertical line on the x-axis,
                find two lines that form a container with the maximum water capacity...
                The capacity is determined by the shorter line and the width between them...

        Approach :-
             > The approach uses the two-pointer technique to maximize the water capacity efficiently...
             > We initialize two pointers: low at the beginning and high at the end. The water capacity between
                    two lines is calculated as width Ã— min( height [ low ], height [ high ])...
             > We update the maximum capacity found so far. Since water capacity depends on the shorter
                line, we move the pointer pointing to the smaller height inward to explore a potentially larger
                    container. This process continues until low meets high....
             > Time Complexity = O(n)...
             > Space Complexity = O(1)...
