Description:
  Following program demonstrates the solution to the "Two Sum" or "Find Indices For Pair Sum" problem using a HashMap-based approach...

Problem Statement:
  -> Given an array of integers and a target sum...
  -> Find indices of two numbers in the array such that they add up to the given target sum...
  -> Return the indices of the two numbers if found, otherwise return null...

Approach:
  > HashMap-Based One-Pass Solution:
     i. Use a HashMap to store values and their indices as we traverse the array...
     ii. For each element, check if its complement (target sum - current element) exists in the map...
     iii. If found, return the indices of both numbers; otherwise, continue...

> Algorithm Steps:
  -> Initialize an empty HashMap to store array values (key) and their indices (value)...
  -> Iterate through the array once...
  -> For each element arr[i], calculate the complement: remain = sum - arr[i]...
  -> Check if the complement exists in the HashMap...
  -> If found, return the pair of indices [complementIndex, currentIndex]...
  -> If not found, store the current element and its index in the HashMap...
  -> If no pair is found after the entire traversal, return null...

> Edge Cases:
  -> Handle empty or null arrays by returning null...
  -> The solution assumes there's at most one valid answer...
  -> The solution works for arrays with both positive and negative integers...

> HashMap Advantage:
  -> Using a HashMap reduces the time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n)...
  -> The key insight is trading space complexity for time efficiency...
  -> Complement lookup becomes O(1) instead of O(n)...

> Time and Space Complexity:
  -> Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the array...
  -> Space Complexity: O(n) for storing array elements and their indices in the HashMap...
