/*
        Description :-
            We have to find the maximum product of any contiguous sub-array within a given array,
            with optimized space and time complexity...

        Approach :-
            > The approach uses Kadane's algorithm adapted for products...
            > It handles positive, negative, and zero values by tracking both prefix and suffix products
                    simultaneously. However, the implementation has a bug - suffix should be calculated from
                    the end of the array...
            > The correct approach should track max and min products at each position to handle negative
                    numbers properly.
            > Time Complexity = O(n) because of a single traversal...
            > Space Complexity = O(1) because we didn't use any extra-space to solve the question...
