        Description :-
            We have to find rearrange a linked list in odd even manner...
            e.g :-
                input = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
                output = 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8

        Approach :-
            -> Initialization:
               > Start by creating pointers to manage the odd-indexed and even-indexed nodes.
               > odd pointer will begin at the head (first node).
               > even pointer will begin at the second node.
               > Keep a reference to the head of the even list (evenHead).

            -> Traversing and Rearranging:
               > Loop through the list while ensuring that the even node and its next node exist.
               > Adjust the next pointers to link odd nodes together and even nodes together.
                    This involves skipping over the opposite type (odd skipping even, and vice versa).

            -> Connecting Odd and Even Lists:
               > After the loop, link the last node of the odd-indexed list to the head of the
                    even-indexed list (evenHead).

        Benefits of This Approach :-
            -> Optimized Space Complexity:
               > The approach uses O(1) extra space as it doesnâ€™t require additional data structures,
                    just a few pointers.

            -> Linear Time Complexity:
               > The algorithm runs in O(n) time where n is the number of nodes in the linked list,
                as it traverses each node exactly once.
