Description:
    Following program demonstrates three different approaches to solve the "Climbing Stairs" problem
    using dynamic programming, recursion, and optimized iteration...

Problem Statement:
    -> Given a staircase with n steps...
    -> A person can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time...
    -> The task is to find the total number of distinct ways to climb to the top...

Approach:
    > Three Different Implementations:
        i. Dynamic Programming with tabulation (bottom-up)...
        ii. Simple Recursion (top-down)...
        iii. Space-Optimized Iteration (Fibonacci-style)...

    > Algorithm Steps for Method 1 (Dynamic Programming):
        -> Initialization:
            1. Create a DP array of size n+1 to store the number of ways for each step...
            2. Set base cases: dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1...

        -> DP state transition:
            1. Iterate from step 2 to n...
            2. For each step i, the number of ways equals the sum of ways to reach the previous two steps...
            3. Use the recurrence relation: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]...

        -> Result calculation:
            1. Return dp[n] as the final answer...

    > Algorithm Steps for Method 2 (Recursion):
        -> Base cases:
            1. If n = 1, return 1 (only one way to climb 1 step)...
            2. If n = 2, return 2 (two ways to climb 2 steps: 1+1 or 2)...

        -> Recursive calculation:
            1. For any other n, calculate recursively using the formula: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)...
            2. This follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern...

    > Algorithm Steps for Method 3 (Space-Optimized):
        -> Base cases:
            1. If n â‰¤ 3, return n directly...

        -> Iterative calculation:
            1. Initialize variables i = 2 (ways for 2 steps) and j = 3 (ways for 3 steps)...
            2. Iterate from step 3 to n-1...
            3. Calculate count = i + j for current step...
            4. Update i = j and j = count for next iteration...

        -> Result calculation:
            1. Return the final count...

    > Key Characteristics:
        -> The problem follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern...
        -> Each solution trades off between time and space complexity...
        -> The DP solution uses O(n) space but avoids recalculations...
        -> The recursive solution is elegant but has exponential time complexity...
        -> The optimized solution achieves O(n) time with O(1) space...
        -> All three methods produce the same mathematical result...

    > Implementation Details:
        -> Method 1 uses an array to store all intermediate results...
        -> Method 2 uses pure recursion but suffers from redundant calculations...
        -> Method 3 uses only variables to track the necessary previous values...
        -> The program demonstrates all three methods with n = 16...
        -> Each method is implemented as a separate function for clarity...

    > Time and Space Complexity:
        -> Method 1 (DP): O(n) time, O(n) space...
        -> Method 2 (Recursion): O(2^n) time, O(n) space (recursion stack)...
        -> Method 3 (Optimized): O(n) time, O(1) space...
