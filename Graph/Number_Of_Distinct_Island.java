Description:
   Following program demonstrates the solution to the "Number of Distinct Islands" problem using Depth-First Search (DFS)...

Problem Statement:
   -> Given an n×m binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water...
   -> An island is a group of 1's connected horizontally or vertically (4-directionally)...
   -> Two islands are considered distinct if their shapes are different (not counting rotations and reflections)...
   -> The task is to count the number of distinct islands in the grid...

Approach:
   > Shape-Based Island Identification:
      i. Use DFS to explore each island and encode its shape...
      ii. Store each island's shape representation in a HashSet to count unique shapes...
      iii. Use relative coordinates from the starting point of each island to represent its shape...

> DFS Implementation:
   -> For each unvisited land cell (1), start a DFS traversal to explore the entire island...
   -> During DFS, record the relative position of each cell to the starting point of the island...
   -> This creates a unique "signature" for the shape of each island...
   -> Add this signature to a HashSet to eliminate duplicates...

> Shape Encoding:
   -> Use the starting cell of each island as a base reference point (baseRow, baseCol)...
   -> For each cell in the island, store its position relative to this base point as "row_diff,col_diff"...
   -> This ensures that islands with the same shape but different positions will have identical encodings...

> Direction Exploration:
   -> Use direction arrays (rows[] and cols[]) to explore the four adjacent cells (up, right, down, left)...
   -> For each valid adjacent land cell that hasn't been visited, continue the DFS traversal...

> Counting Distinct Islands:
   -> The size of the HashSet containing all unique island shapes gives the count of distinct islands...

> Data Structures:
   -> Use a boolean array to track visited cells...
   -> Use ArrayList<String> to store the shape encoding of each island...
   -> Use HashSet<ArrayList<String>> to store unique island shapes...
   -> Use direction arrays (rows, cols) to explore adjacent cells...

> Time and Space Complexity:
   -> Time Complexity: O(n×m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid...
   -> Space Complexity: O(n×m) for the visited array and in the worst case for storing all island shapes...
