/*

Description:
    -> This program detects whether a **directed graph** contains a cycle using Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-based Topological Sorting)...
    -> The presence of a cycle is determined by checking whether a valid topological ordering is possible...

Problem Statement:
    -> Given a directed graph with V vertices and a list of edges...
    -> Return true if the graph contains a cycle, otherwise return false...
    -> A graph has a cycle if and only if a valid topological sort is not possible...

Approach:
    > In-Degree Calculation:
        -> Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex...

    > Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS):
        -> Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to a queue...
        -> Repeatedly remove nodes from the queue and reduce in-degrees of adjacent nodes...
        -> Track how many nodes are processed...

    > Cycle Detection:
        -> If the number of processed nodes is less than the total number of vertices, a cycle exists...
        -> This means some nodes couldn't be sorted topologically due to circular dependencies...

Algorithm Steps:
    -> Step 1: Initialize `inDegrees[]` array of size V to 0...
    -> Step 2: Traverse the adjacency list and update in-degree of each node...
    -> Step 3: Add all nodes with in-degree 0 to a queue...
    -> Step 4: While the queue is not empty:
        a. Remove a node from the queue and increment the processed count...
        b. For each neighbor, decrement its in-degree...
        c. If a neighbor’s in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue...
    -> Step 5: After processing, if count < V → cycle exists...

Key Characteristics:
    -> Uses BFS-style topological sort to detect cycles in a directed graph...
    -> Efficient for large graphs due to linear time traversal...
    -> Does not modify the original graph structure...

Time and Space Complexity:
    -> Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges...
    -> Space Complexity: O(V), for storing in-degrees and queue...

Demonstration:
    -> Input Edges:
        1→2→3→4→5→6
               ↓
               7→5
        and a separate cycle: 8→9→10→8
    -> Component with 8, 9, 10 forms a cycle...
    -> Output: This graph contains a cycle...
