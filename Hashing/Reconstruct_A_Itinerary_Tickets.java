/*
        Description :-
            We have to find one sequential travel route, so that we can start from one station/airport
            and visit all the cities...

        Approach :-
            > Store Paths in a HashMap: Store the flight paths in a hashmap where the key is the departure city,
                and the value is the destination city...
            > Identify the Start Point: To find the starting point of the journey, identify a city that is not a
                destination in any of the given paths. This is achieved using a hashset to track all destination cities
                and then finding a departure city that isnâ€™t in that set...
            > Reconstruct the Itinerary: Once the start city is identified, use it to trace the entire path by continuously
                getting the next destination from the hashmap until no more destinations are found...
