        Description :-
            We have to find out the Peak element in the array...
            Peak element - a element which is strictly greater than it's neighbours...
            But we have condition - Time complexity shouldn't exceed O(log(n))...

        Approach :-
            > So,the typical low and high pointer,then iterate until low <= high...
            > We have to get the mid-index ,then check for its neighbours ,if it satisfies
                the condition then return it's value else check for if it's less than the next
                element then then update low otherwise update high...
