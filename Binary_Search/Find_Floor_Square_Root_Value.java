/*
        Description :-
            We have to find out the Square root (Floor value) of a number...
            But we have condition - Time complexity shouldn't exceed O(log(n))...

        Approach :-
            > So,the typical low and high pointer,then iterate until low <= high...
            > We have to get the mid-index ,then check for its square is less than the
                given number ,then increment the low pointer otherwise decrement the high
                pointer...
